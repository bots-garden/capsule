# Worker

> We can have several worker

- start a capsule http server
- with an url to a wasm module (generate a unique name for the downloaded file)
- with a http port (the scheduler is in charge to choose the port => increment)
- with a function name
- with a revision
- register the function to the reverse proxy


=> scale a revision
